# Multiwin — Tauri Patterns Ep 4

Demo app for **Episode 4: Open a Second Window in Tauri 2 — Multi-Window React + Rust Tutorial** of the [Tauri Patterns for Production](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOeWRYj1QznVJfg6w0_l8M5WUXP7Nf32x) series by Codegiz.

A small multi-window app built on Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript. A React button spawns a real native OS window with its own URL, size, and lifecycle — no Electron, no pop-up hacks, just the `WebviewWindow` API.

## Episode topics

- `new WebviewWindow(label, options)` from `@tauri-apps/api/webviewWindow` — spawn windows from JS.
- Routing two HTML entry points through one Vite build.
- The capability needed to create new windows at runtime.
- Window-to-window communication: events with a window-scoped channel.
- When multi-window beats a router-based single-window flow (settings panels, picker dialogs, detail views).
